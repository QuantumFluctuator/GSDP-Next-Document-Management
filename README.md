Get ready for using MySQL by next week.
Either:
Set up an account on homepages.shu.ac.uk at
https://dbutils.shu.ac.uk/mysqlutility
then check phpMyAdmin is working at:
http://homepages.shu.ac.uk/mysql
Password should be 6-8 characters in length and include a numeric value.
Alternatively:
use XAMPP on your own machine to set up an Apache, MySQL, PHP, PHPMyAdmin stack.
You can, of course do, it both ways so you can work at both home and in the labs.
